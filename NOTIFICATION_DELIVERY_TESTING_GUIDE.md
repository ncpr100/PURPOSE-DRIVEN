# Notification Delivery System - Testing Guide

## üéØ Overview
The notification system has been upgraded with a proper **NotificationDelivery** tracking model that provides:
- **Per-user read state tracking** (no more shared read flags)
- **Delivery status monitoring** (PENDING, DELIVERED, FAILED, BOUNCED)
- **Multi-channel delivery support** (in-app, email, push, SMS)
- **Enterprise-grade delivery analytics**

## üîß Implementation Summary

### Schema Changes
- **Added**: `NotificationDelivery` model with proper user relationships
- **Removed**: `isRead` field from `Notification` model (now per-user in deliveries)
- **Enhanced**: Foreign key constraints and performance indexes

### Updated Endpoints
1. **`/api/notifications/acknowledge`** - Now uses delivery records instead of shared state
2. **`/api/notifications/bulk`** - Creates delivery records for all target users
3. **`/api/notifications`** (GET) - Queries delivery records for user-specific read state
4. **`/api/notifications`** (POST) - Creates delivery records based on targeting

### Key Benefits
- ‚úÖ **No more shared read state bugs** - each user has individual delivery tracking
- ‚úÖ **Better analytics** - track delivery success/failure per user per channel
- ‚úÖ **Scalable design** - supports multi-channel delivery (email, push, SMS)
- ‚úÖ **Performance optimized** - proper indexes for fast queries

## üß™ Testing Scenarios

### P1 - Core Functionality Tests

#### Test 1: Individual Notification Delivery
```bash
# Create a notification for a specific user
curl -X POST /api/notifications \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "title": "Test Individual Notification",
    "message": "This is a test message for a specific user",
    "type": "INFO",
    "targetUser": "user_id_here"
  }'

# Expected: NotificationDelivery record created for the target user
# Verify: Check database for delivery record with userId and notificationId
```

#### Test 2: Role-Based Notification Delivery
```bash
# Create a notification for all PASTORs
curl -X POST /api/notifications \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "title": "Pastor Meeting Reminder",
    "message": "Monthly pastor meeting tomorrow at 10 AM",
    "type": "INFO",
    "targetRole": "PASTOR"
  }'

# Expected: NotificationDelivery records created for all users with role PASTOR
# Verify: Count delivery records matches count of users with PASTOR role
```

#### Test 3: Global Church Notification Delivery
```bash
# Create a global notification for entire church
curl -X POST /api/notifications \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "title": "Church-wide Announcement",
    "message": "Important update for all church members",
    "type": "WARNING",
    "isGlobal": true
  }'

# Expected: NotificationDelivery records created for all active church users
# Verify: Count delivery records matches count of active users in church
```

#### Test 4: Bulk Notification with Template
```bash
# Send bulk notification using template
curl -X POST /api/notifications/bulk \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "templateId": "template_id_here",
    "targetType": "ALL",
    "variables": {
      "userName": "{{user.name}}",
      "eventDate": "November 1st"
    }
  }'

# Expected: Template applied, delivery records created for all church users
# Verify: Template variables replaced correctly in notification content
```

#### Test 5: Notification Acknowledgment
```bash
# Mark a notification as read
curl -X POST /api/notifications/acknowledge \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "notificationId": "notification_id_here"
  }'

# Expected: Delivery record updated with isRead=true and readAt timestamp
# Verify: Only the current user's delivery record is updated
```

#### Test 6: Fetch User Notifications
```bash
# Get user's notifications (unread only)
curl -X GET "/api/notifications?unreadOnly=true&limit=10"

# Expected: Returns notifications with per-user read state from delivery records
# Verify: isRead status reflects user's individual read state, not shared state
```

### P2 - Advanced Tests

#### Test 7: Multi-Channel Delivery Tracking
```bash
# Simulate email delivery tracking
# (This would be triggered by email webhook or delivery service)
UPDATE notification_deliveries 
SET deliveryStatus = 'DELIVERED', deliveryMethod = 'email', deliveredAt = NOW()
WHERE notificationId = 'notification_id' AND userId = 'user_id';

# Expected: Delivery record updated with email-specific delivery status
# Verify: Can track multiple delivery methods per notification per user
```

#### Test 8: Delivery Failure Tracking
```bash
# Simulate push notification failure
UPDATE notification_deliveries 
SET deliveryStatus = 'FAILED', failureReason = 'Device token expired'
WHERE notificationId = 'notification_id' AND userId = 'user_id' AND deliveryMethod = 'push';

# Expected: Failure tracked with reason for debugging
# Verify: Failed deliveries don't affect other delivery methods
```

### P3 - Performance & Edge Cases

#### Test 9: Large-Scale Bulk Delivery
```bash
# Test bulk notification to large user base (>1000 users)
curl -X POST /api/notifications/bulk \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "title": "Large Scale Test",
    "message": "Testing delivery to many users",
    "type": "INFO",
    "targetType": "GLOBAL"
  }'

# Expected: Efficient bulk creation of delivery records
# Verify: Performance acceptable, no timeouts or memory issues
```

#### Test 10: Concurrent Acknowledgment
```bash
# Multiple users acknowledging notifications simultaneously
# Simulate concurrent requests to /api/notifications/acknowledge

# Expected: No race conditions, each user's state tracked independently
# Verify: Database consistency maintained under concurrent load
```

## üîç Database Verification Queries

### Check Delivery Records Creation
```sql
-- Verify delivery records are created for notifications
SELECT 
  n.title,
  COUNT(nd.id) as delivery_count,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN nd.isRead = true THEN 1 END) as read_count
FROM notifications n
LEFT JOIN notification_deliveries nd ON n.id = nd.notificationId
GROUP BY n.id, n.title
ORDER BY n.createdAt DESC;
```

### Check Per-User Read State
```sql
-- Verify individual user read states
SELECT 
  u.name as user_name,
  n.title as notification_title,
  nd.isRead,
  nd.readAt,
  nd.deliveryStatus
FROM notification_deliveries nd
JOIN notifications n ON nd.notificationId = n.id
JOIN users u ON nd.userId = u.id
WHERE u.email = 'user@example.com'
ORDER BY nd.createdAt DESC;
```

### Check Delivery Status Distribution
```sql
-- Monitor delivery success rates
SELECT 
  deliveryMethod,
  deliveryStatus,
  COUNT(*) as count,
  ROUND(COUNT(*) * 100.0 / SUM(COUNT(*)) OVER(), 2) as percentage
FROM notification_deliveries
GROUP BY deliveryMethod, deliveryStatus
ORDER BY deliveryMethod, deliveryStatus;
```

## üöÄ Deployment Notes

1. **Migration Required**: Run the notification delivery migration before deployment
2. **Backward Compatibility**: Old notification queries will fail - ensure all clients updated
3. **Performance**: New indexes improve query performance but require migration time
4. **Monitoring**: Track delivery success rates for system health
