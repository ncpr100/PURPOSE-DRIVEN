## 🚨 Known Issues & Limitations

### Member Data

- ✅ Planning Center email format (firstname.lastname.{num}@planningcenter.email)
- ✅ Random birth dates (1950-2010)

- ⚠️ No member photos (photo field is NULL)
- ⚠️ No notes on most members
- ⚠️ Spiritual gifts not populated

### User Accounts
- ✅ 56 users can login (1 admin + 5 pastors + 50 leaders)
- ⚠️ 944 members are records only (no user account)
- ⚠️ All users have same default password
- ⚠️ No email verification performed

### Automation
- ✅ Automation templates created in previous session
- ⚠️ Need to activate templates manually
- ⚠️ No historical automation executions (fresh church)

---

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### "Can't see members"
```bash
# Check you're logged into correct church
# Iglesia de Prueba has 0 members (by design)
# Iglesia Comunidad de Fe has 999 members

# Login as: admin@comunidaddefe.org
```

### "Can't login as pastor/leader"
```bash
# Email format: firstname.lastname.{number}@planningcenter.email
# Password: ChurchMember2025!

# Example pastor emails (check database for exact):
# - carlos.rodriguez.1000@planningcenter.email
# - maria.garcia.1001@planningcenter.email
```

### "Performance is slow"
```bash
# Expected with 999 members
# Check database indexes are in place
# Consider implementing pagination
# Use member search instead of browsing all
```

### "Automation not triggering"
```bash
# Ensure automation templates are activated
# Check automation rules are enabled
# Verify webhook URLs are correct
# Check automation dashboard for errors
```
