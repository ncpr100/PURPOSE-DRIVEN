# üéØ KHESED-TEK PLATFORM TESTING WORKFLOW

**Testing Date**: October 17, 2025  
**Church**: Iglesia Comunidad de Fe  
**Test Data**: 999 migrated members from Planning Center  

---

## üîß ISSUE #1: DEMOGRAPHIC BREAKDOWN NOT SHOWING

### Current Problem
‚úÖ **Total Members**: Shows 999 correctly  
‚ùå **Hombres (Men)**: Shows 0 (WRONG!)  
‚ùå **Mujeres (Women)**: Shows 0 (WRONG!)  

### Root Cause
**Data mismatch**: Migration created gender as "Masculino"/"Femenino" but the filter checks for lowercase "masculino"/"femenino"

### Fix Required
Update line 667-668 in `/app/(dashboard)/members/_components/members-client.tsx`:

```typescript
// WRONG (case-sensitive):
{filteredMembers.filter(m => m.gender === 'masculino').length}
{filteredMembers.filter(m => m.gender === 'femenino').length}

// CORRECT (case-insensitive):
{filteredMembers.filter(m => m.gender?.toLowerCase() === 'masculino').length}
{filteredMembers.filter(m => m.gender?.toLowerCase() === 'femenino').length}
```

## üêõ KNOWN ISSUES TO FIX

### HIGH PRIORITY
1. ‚ùå **Gender Demographics Not Showing**
   - Location: `/app/(dashboard)/members/_components/members-client.tsx:667-672`
   - Fix: Case-insensitive gender comparison
   - Impact: Statistics cards show 0 for Hombres/Mujeres

2. ‚ùå **No Family Grouping Feature**
   - Status: Feature doesn't exist yet
   - Impact: Cannot view families together
   - Solution: Add Families tab (new feature request)

### MEDIUM PRIORITY
3. ‚ö†Ô∏è **Gender Filter Doesn't Match Data**
   - Location: Same file, line 341
   - Data uses "Masculino"/"Femenino" (capitalized)
   - Filter checks "masculino"/"femenino" (lowercase)
   - Fix: Case-insensitive filter

4. ‚ö†Ô∏è **No Member Photos**
   - All 999 members have NULL photo field
   - Impact: Member list shows no avatars
   - Solution: Add photo upload in member form

### LOW PRIORITY
5. ‚ÑπÔ∏è **Spiritual Gifts Not Populated**
   - Migrated members don't have spiritual gifts assigned
   - Impact: Volunteer recommendations less accurate
   - Solution: Add spiritual gifts assessment workflow

6. ‚ÑπÔ∏è **All Users Have Same Password**
   - 56 user accounts all use "ChurchMember2025!"
   - Impact: Security concern for production
   - Solution: Force password reset on first login
