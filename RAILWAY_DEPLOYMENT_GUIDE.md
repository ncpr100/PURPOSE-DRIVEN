   railway link
   # Select your project from the list
   ```

4. **Run migrations**:
   ```bash
   # This runs migrations against your Railway database
   railway run npx prisma migrate deploy
   ```

5. **Verify indexes were created**:
   ```bash
   railway run node -e "
   const { PrismaClient } = require('@prisma/client');
   const prisma = new PrismaClient();
   
   async function checkIndexes() {
     const result = await prisma.\$queryRaw\`
       SELECT indexname 
       FROM pg_indexes 
       WHERE tablename IN ('volunteer_assignments', 'volunteer_recommendations', 'member_spiritual_profiles')
         AND indexname LIKE 'idx_%'
       ORDER BY indexname
     \`;
     console.log('✅ INDEXES FOUND:');
     result.forEach((row, i) => console.log(\`  \${i+1}. \${row.indexname}\`));
     await prisma.\$disconnect();
   }
   
   checkIndexes();
   "
   ```

#### Method 2: Using Railway Web Terminal

1. In Railway dashboard, click on your **Web Service**
2. Go to **"Deployments"** tab
3. Click on the **latest deployment**

   ```
   ✓ Compiled successfully
   ✓ Creating an optimized production build
   ✓ Collecting page data
   ✓ Build completed
   ```

**Expected Build Time:** 5-10 minutes  
**Status:** Monitor for any errors in logs

---

### **STEP 9: Get Your Application URL**

1. Once deployment succeeds, go to **"Settings"** tab
2. Scroll to **"Domains"** section
3. You'll see your Railway-generated domain:
   ```
   https://your-app-name.up.railway.app
   ```

4. **Optional:** Add a custom domain
   - Click **"+ Custom Domain"**
   - Enter your domain (e.g., `app.yourdomain.com`)
   - Follow DNS configuration instructions

5. **Update Environment Variables:**
   - Go back to **"Variables"** tab
   - Update `NEXTAUTH_URL` with your actual URL
   - Update `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` with your actual URL
   - Click **"Save"** (this will trigger a redeploy)

**Time:** 5 minutes (wait for redeploy after updating URLs)

---

### **STEP 10: Execute Smoke Tests**

Now test your deployed application!

#### Test 1: Application Loads
```bash
# Visit your Railway URL
https://your-app-name.up.railway.app

# Expected: Homepage loads successfully
# Status: Should see your login page or dashboard
```

#### Test 2: Input Validation (API Security)
```bash
# Test volunteer API with invalid email
curl -X POST https://your-app-name.up.railway.app/api/volunteers \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Cookie: your-session-cookie" \
  -d '{"email": "invalid-email", "firstName": "Test"}'

# Expected: 400 Bad Request
# Response: {"error": "Invalid email format"}
```

#### Test 3: Performance Check (Volunteer Matching)
```bash
# Test volunteer matching speed
time curl -X POST https://your-app-name.up.railway.app/api/volunteer-matching \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Cookie: your-session-cookie" \
  -d '{"ministryId": "valid-ministry-id", "maxRecommendations": 10}'

# Expected: Response in < 500ms (was 7.5s before optimization)
# Status: Should see matched volunteers
```

#### Test 4: Excel Import (Security Fix)
```bash
# Upload a test Excel file
curl -X POST https://your-app-name.up.railway.app/api/members/import \
  -H "Cookie: your-session-cookie" \
  -F "file=@test-members.xlsx"

# Expected: Successful import
# Response: {"success": true, "imported": X, "updated": Y}
```

#### Test 5: Database Check (Indexes)
Use Railway CLI:
```bash
railway run node -e "
const { PrismaClient } = require('@prisma/client');
const prisma = new PrismaClient();

async function testQuery() {
  console.time('Query Time');
  const assignments = await prisma.volunteerAssignment.findMany({
    where: {
      date: { gte: new Date('2025-01-01') }
    },
    take: 10
  });
  console.timeEnd('Query Time');
  console.log(\`Found \${assignments.length} assignments\`);
  await prisma.\$disconnect();
}

testQuery();
"

# Expected: Query time < 100ms (indexes working)
```

**Time:** 10-15 minutes  
**Status:** All tests should pass! ✅

---

### **STEP 11: Monitor Production (First 24 Hours)**

#### In Railway Dashboard:

1. **Go to "Observability" tab** (or Metrics)
2. **Monitor these metrics:**
   - **CPU Usage**: Should be stable, not spiking
   - **Memory Usage**: Should be < 512MB for typical load
   - **Response Time**: Should be < 500ms average
   - **Error Rate**: Should be < 1%

3. **Watch the Logs:**
   - Go to **"Deployments"** → **"View Logs"**
   - Look for any errors or warnings
   - Check for database connection issues

#### Check Database Performance:

```bash
# Connect to Railway database
railway run npx prisma studio

# Or check index usage
railway run psql $DATABASE_URL -c "
SELECT 
    schemaname,
    tablename,
    indexname,
    idx_scan as scans,
    idx_tup_read as rows_read,
    idx_tup_fetch as rows_fetched
FROM pg_stat_user_indexes
WHERE indexname LIKE 'idx_volunteer%' 
   OR indexname LIKE 'idx_member_spiritual%'
ORDER BY idx_scan DESC;
"

# Expected: All 4 indexes should show scan counts > 0
```

#### Monitor Application Health:

```bash
# Health check endpoint (if you have one)
curl https://your-app-name.up.railway.app/api/health

# Monitor response times
for i in {1..10}; do
  curl -w "\nTime: %{time_total}s\n" \
    -o /dev/null -s \
    https://your-app-name.up.railway.app/api/volunteers
  sleep 2
done

# Expected: All responses < 1 second
```

**Monitoring Duration:** 24 hours minimum  
**Alert Thresholds:**
- Response time > 1s → Investigate
- Error rate > 1% → Check logs immediately
- CPU > 80% sustained → Consider scaling
- Memory > 80% → Check for memory leaks

## 🚨 TROUBLESHOOTING

### Issue: Build Fails

**Symptoms:** Deployment fails during build phase

**Solutions:**
1. Check build logs for specific error
2. Verify all dependencies in package.json
3. Ensure Node version compatibility:
   ```json
   // In package.json
   "engines": {
     "node": ">=18.0.0",
     "npm": ">=9.0.0"
   }
   ```
4. Clear Railway build cache:
   - Settings → Build & Deploy → Clear Cache → Redeploy

---

### Issue: Application Crashes on Start

**Symptoms:** App deploys but immediately crashes

**Solutions:**
1. Check application logs in Railway
2. Verify DATABASE_URL is correct
3. Ensure all required env variables are set
4. Check if Prisma client is generated:
   ```bash
   railway run npx prisma generate
   ```

---

### Issue: Database Connection Failed

**Symptoms:** "Can't reach database server" errors

**Solutions:**
1. Verify DATABASE_URL format:
   ```
   postgresql://USER:PASSWORD@HOST:PORT/DATABASE
   ```
2. Check PostgreSQL service is running in Railway
3. Verify database and app are in same Railway project
4. Test connection:
   ```bash
   railway run npx prisma db push --skip-generate
   ```

---

### Issue: Migrations Not Applied

**Symptoms:** "Table does not exist" errors

**Solutions:**
1. Manually run migrations:
   ```bash
   railway run npx prisma migrate deploy
   ```
2. Check migration status:
   ```bash
   railway run npx prisma migrate status
   ```
3. If needed, reset and re-run:
   ```bash
   railway run npx prisma migrate reset --force
   railway run npx prisma migrate deploy
   ```

---

### Issue: Slow Performance

**Symptoms:** API responses > 1 second

**Solutions:**
1. Check if indexes were created:
   ```bash
   railway run psql $DATABASE_URL -c "\d volunteer_assignments"
   ```
2. Verify connection pooling:
   ```typescript
   // In lib/prisma.ts
   const prisma = new PrismaClient({
     datasources: {
       db: {
         url: process.env.DATABASE_URL + "?connection_limit=10&pool_timeout=10"
       }
     }
   })
   ```
3. Monitor database queries in Railway Observability

---

### Issue: Environment Variables Not Working

**Symptoms:** App can't read env variables

**Solutions:**
1. Verify variables are set in Railway dashboard
2. Check variable names (case-sensitive!)
3. Redeploy after adding/changing variables
