**Subject:** `URGENT FOLLOW-UP: Development Mode Environment Variable Override Request`

```
Dear AbacusAI Support Team,

ESCALATION NOTICE: This is a follow-up to my support request submitted >48 hours ago regarding platform environment variable injection blocking local development.

ORIGINAL REQUEST:
- Project: K·∏•esed-tek Church Management System
- Issue: Platform NEXTAUTH_URL injection overriding local .env settings
- Evidence: HRM-22 diagnostic protocol confirmed platform injection
- Impact: Complete development workflow blockage

CURRENT STATUS:
- No initial response received after 48+ hours
- Expected response time: 24-48 hours (exceeded)
- Business impact: Daily productivity loss continues

IMMEDIATE NEEDS:
1. Confirmation of ticket receipt and assignment
2. Estimated timeline for technical assessment  
3. Escalation to senior technical team if needed

INTERIM SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED:
We've implemented a localhost detection workaround, but platform enhancement is still required for proper development experience.

REQUEST URGENCY:
This issue affects fundamental development workflow and platform usability. Please prioritize this request or advise on alternative escalation channels.

Thank you for your urgent attention.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
Reference: Original request submitted [DATE]
