## 🔍 Testing

**Valid request**:
```bash
curl -X POST /api/volunteers \
  -d '{"firstName":"John","lastName":"Doe","email":"john@example.com","skills":["Music"]}'
```
Expected: ✅ 200 OK

**Invalid email**:
```bash
curl -X POST /api/volunteers \
  -d '{"firstName":"John","lastName":"Doe","email":"invalid","skills":["Music"]}'
```
Expected: ❌ 400 with "Invalid email format"

**Conflict detection**:
```bash
# Create two overlapping assignments for same volunteer
curl -X POST /api/volunteer-assignments \
  -d '{"volunteerId":"abc","date":"2025-10-20","startTime":"10:00","endTime":"12:00",...}'
curl -X POST /api/volunteer-assignments \
  -d '{"volunteerId":"abc","date":"2025-10-20","startTime":"11:00","endTime":"13:00",...}'
```
Expected: ❌ 409 Conflict
