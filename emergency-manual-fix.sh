echo "👑 SUPER_ADMIN USER:"
echo "   1. Click 'Add User'"
echo "   2. Email: soporte@khesed-tek-systems.org"
echo "   3. Password: Bendecido100%$$%"

echo "📞 THEN WAIT FOR DATABASE TO INITIALIZE"
echo "   - Supabase databases can take 10-15 minutes to fully start"
echo "   - Keep trying login every few minutes"

echo "🧪 TEST LOGIN AT:"
echo "   https://khesed-tek-cms-org.vercel.app/auth/signin"

echo "💡 WHY MANUAL CREATION WORKS:"
echo "   - Supabase Auth works independently of custom database tables"
echo "   - Once Auth users exist, they can login even before DB schema is ready" 
echo "   - Database tables will be created when connection becomes available"

echo "⏰ KEEP TESTING EVERY 5 MINUTES UNTIL LOGIN WORKS!"
