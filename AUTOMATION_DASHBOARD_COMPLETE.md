## 🚀 HOW TO ACCESS

### **URL:** http://localhost:3000/automation-rules/dashboard

### **Authentication Required:**
- ✅ Must be logged in
- ✅ Must have a church assigned
- ✅ Data is church-scoped (multi-tenant safe)

---

## 📈 USAGE SCENARIOS

### **For Church Admins:**
```
Daily Check:
1. Login to dashboard
2. View success rate → Should be > 90%
3. Check failed executions → Investigate errors
4. Review manual tasks → Approve pending actions
5. Monitor active rules → Ensure critical ones are enabled
```

### **For Super Admins:**
```
System Monitoring:
1. Watch real-time executions (auto-refresh ON)
2. Analyze average execution time → Optimize slow rules
3. Check retry patterns → Identify communication issues
4. Review error logs → Fix configuration problems
5. Monitor escalation queue → Ensure timely responses
```

### **For Prayer Team:**
```
Response Monitoring:
1. Check pending manual tasks
2. See urgent prayer executions
3. Verify 24/7 notifications sent
4. Review escalation timing
5. Approve phone call follow-ups
```

### **For Welcome Team:**
```
Visitor Follow-Up:
1. Check first-time visitor executions
2. Review categorization accuracy
3. Monitor welcome sequence delivery
4. Approve member candidate invitations
5. Track visitor engagement
```

---

## 🔍 WHAT TO MONITOR

### **✅ Healthy System Indicators:**
- Success rate > 90%
- Average execution time < 5 seconds
- No failed executions with retries exhausted
- Manual tasks being processed within SLA
- Active rules > 0 (at least some automation enabled)

### **⚠️ Warning Signs:**
- Success rate 70-90% → Review failed executions
- Average execution time > 10 seconds → Performance issue
- Many RETRYING executions → Communication service problems
- Old pending manual tasks (> 24 hours) → Staff not responding
- All rules inactive → System disabled

### **❌ Critical Issues:**
- Success rate < 70% → System malfunction
- All executions FAILED → Configuration error or service outage
- Average time > 30 seconds → Serious performance problem
- Manual tasks > 50 pending → Staff overwhelmed or not assigned

---

## 🛠️ TROUBLESHOOTING

### **No Data Showing:**
```
Possible Causes:
1. No automation rules created yet → Create rules
2. No rules activated → Activate templates
3. No triggers fired → Create test prayer/check-in
4. Database connection issue → Check .env
5. Not logged in → Authentication required
```

### **Empty Recent Executions:**
```
This is NORMAL if:
- System just installed
- No templates activated
- No prayer requests or check-ins created yet

Action: Create test data to populate dashboard
```

### **High Failure Rate:**
```
Check:
1. Twilio credentials (SMS failures)
2. Mailgun credentials (Email failures)
3. Network connectivity
4. Rate limits on external services
5. Invalid phone numbers/emails in test data
```
