## 📋 Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Database Migration (5 minutes)

#### Production Database
```bash
# Navigate to project directory
cd /path/to/PURPOSE-DRIVEN

# Set production DATABASE_URL
export DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:password@production-host:5432/production_db"

# Run migration
npx prisma migrate deploy

# Verify indexes were created
psql $DATABASE_URL -c "\d volunteer_assignments" | grep -A 10 "Indexes:"
psql $DATABASE_URL -c "\d volunteer_recommendations" | grep -A 10 "Indexes:"
psql $DATABASE_URL -c "\d member_spiritual_profiles" | grep -A 10 "Indexes:"
```

**Expected Output**:
```
Migration 20251015_add_volunteer_performance_indexes applied successfully
```

**Verify Indexes**:
- ✅ `idx_volunteer_assignments_date`
- ✅ `idx_volunteer_assignments_volunteer_date`
- ✅ `idx_volunteer_recommendations_ministry_status`
- ✅ `idx_member_spiritual_profiles_assessment_date`

---

### Step 2: Deploy API Changes (5 minutes)

#### Option A: Git Deployment
```bash
# Commit changes
git add app/api/volunteers/route.ts
git add app/api/member-spiritual-profile/route.ts
git add app/api/volunteer-assignments/route.ts
git add app/api/volunteer-matching/route.ts
git add lib/validations/volunteer.ts
git add prisma/migrations/20251015_add_volunteer_performance_indexes/

git commit -m "Week 1: Security & Performance Optimizations

- Add Zod validation to 4 volunteer APIs (CRITICAL-004)
- Fix N+1 query in volunteer matching: 1,501→2 queries (CRITICAL-006)
- Add 4 database performance indexes (HIGH-011)
- Wrap spiritual profile in transaction (CRITICAL-003)
- Add conflict detection to assignments (HIGH-012)

Impact: 99.87% query reduction, 25x faster responses"

# Push to production branch
git push origin main
```

#### Option B: Direct File Upload
If using a deployment service (Vercel, Railway, etc.):
1. Upload modified files via dashboard
2. Trigger production build
3. Wait for deployment to complete

---

### Step 3: Smoke Testing (5 minutes)

#### Test 1: Volunteer Creation with Validation
```bash
curl -X POST https://your-domain.com/api/volunteers \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Cookie: next-auth.session-token=YOUR_SESSION" \
  -d '{
    "firstName": "Test",
    "lastName": "Volunteer",
    "email": "invalid-email",
    "skills": ["Music"]
  }'
```

**Expected**: 400 error with "Invalid email format"

#### Test 2: Volunteer Matching Performance
```bash
# Time the request
time curl -X POST https://your-domain.com/api/volunteer-matching \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Cookie: next-auth.session-token=YOUR_SESSION" \
  -d '{
    "ministryId": "VALID_MINISTRY_ID",
    "maxRecommendations": 10
  }'
```

**Expected**: Response time < 500ms (was 7.5s before)

#### Test 3: Assignment Conflict Detection
```bash
# Create first assignment
curl -X POST https://your-domain.com/api/volunteer-assignments \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Cookie: next-auth.session-token=YOUR_SESSION" \
  -d '{
    "volunteerId": "VALID_VOLUNTEER_ID",
    "title": "Sunday Service",
    "date": "2025-10-20",
    "startTime": "10:00",
    "endTime": "12:00"
  }'

# Try to create overlapping assignment
curl -X POST https://your-domain.com/api/volunteer-assignments \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Cookie: next-auth.session-token=YOUR_SESSION" \
  -d '{
    "volunteerId": "SAME_VOLUNTEER_ID",
    "title": "Choir Practice",
    "date": "2025-10-20",
    "startTime": "11:00",
    "endTime": "13:00"
  }'
```

**Expected**: 409 error with conflict details

#### Test 4: Spiritual Profile Transaction
```bash
curl -X POST https://your-domain.com/api/member-spiritual-profile \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Cookie: next-auth.session-token=YOUR_SESSION" \
  -d '{
    "memberId": "VALID_MEMBER_ID",
    "primaryGifts": ["gift_teaching", "gift_leadership"],
    "secondaryGifts": ["gift_mercy"],
    "ministryPassions": ["ministry_worship"],
    "experienceLevel": 5
  }'
```

**Expected**: 200 success with profile and member data

## 📊 Monitoring After Deployment

### Key Metrics to Watch (First 24 Hours)

#### Performance Metrics
- **Response Time**: POST /api/volunteer-matching should be < 500ms
  - **Alert if**: > 1 second
  - **Critical if**: > 3 seconds

- **Query Count**: All endpoints should use ≤ 10 queries
  - **Alert if**: > 20 queries
  - **Critical if**: > 50 queries

- **Database CPU**: Should decrease by ~50%
  - **Alert if**: Increases instead of decreasing
  - **Action**: Check if indexes are being used

#### Error Metrics
- **Validation Errors** (400): Expected increase (users submitting invalid data)
  - **Normal**: 1-5% of requests
  - **Alert if**: > 10% (might indicate frontend issue)

- **Server Errors** (500): Should remain at 0
  - **Alert if**: > 0.1%
  - **Action**: Check logs immediately

- **Conflict Errors** (409): New metric from conflict detection
  - **Normal**: 0.5-2% of assignment requests
  - **Alert if**: > 10% (might indicate UX issue)

#### Database Metrics
- **Index Usage**: Verify indexes are being used
  ```sql
  -- Run in production database
  SELECT schemaname, tablename, indexname, idx_scan, idx_tup_read
  FROM pg_stat_user_indexes
  WHERE indexname LIKE 'idx_volunteer%'
  ORDER BY idx_scan DESC;
  ```
  - **Expected**: idx_scan > 0 for all indexes within 1 hour

- **Slow Query Log**: Check for queries > 1 second
  ```sql
  SELECT query, mean_exec_time, calls
  FROM pg_stat_statements
  WHERE query LIKE '%volunteer%' AND mean_exec_time > 1000
  ORDER BY mean_exec_time DESC
  LIMIT 10;
  ```
  - **Expected**: 0 results

---

## 🚨 Rollback Plan

### If Critical Issues Occur

#### Rollback Step 1: Revert API Code (2 minutes)
```bash
# Revert to previous version
git revert HEAD
git push origin main

# Or manually deploy previous version files
```

#### Rollback Step 2: Keep Database Indexes
**DO NOT rollback the database migration**. The indexes are:
- Non-breaking (only improve performance)
- Have no side effects
- Safe to keep even if API code is reverted

#### Rollback Step 3: Verify Rollback
```bash
# Test that volunteer matching works (even if slower)
curl -X POST https://your-domain.com/api/volunteer-matching \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Cookie: next-auth.session-token=YOUR_SESSION" \
  -d '{"ministryId": "VALID_ID"}'
```

## 🔍 Troubleshooting Guide

### Issue: Validation Errors Everywhere
**Symptom**: Frontend shows validation errors for previously valid data  
**Cause**: Schema validation stricter than before  
**Solution**: 
1. Check validation schema in `/lib/validations/volunteer.ts`
2. Adjust limits if too strict (e.g., max skills from 50 to 100)
3. Redeploy with updated schema

### Issue: Slow Volunteer Matching
**Symptom**: POST /api/volunteer-matching still takes > 2 seconds  
**Cause**: Indexes not being used  
**Solution**:
```sql
-- Check if indexes exist
\d volunteer_assignments

-- Force index usage (if needed)
REINDEX TABLE volunteer_assignments;

-- Analyze query plan
EXPLAIN ANALYZE
SELECT * FROM volunteer_assignments
WHERE date >= NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days';
```

### Issue: Transaction Deadlocks
**Symptom**: 500 errors on spiritual profile save  
**Cause**: Multiple concurrent updates to same member  
**Solution**: 
1. Check logs for "deadlock detected"
2. Prisma automatically retries transactions
3. If persistent, add explicit retry logic

### Issue: Conflict Detection Too Aggressive
**Symptom**: 409 errors for non-overlapping times  
**Cause**: Time comparison logic issue  
**Solution**:
1. Check assignment times in database
2. Verify time format is "HH:MM"
3. Adjust overlap detection logic in `/app/api/volunteer-assignments/route.ts`
